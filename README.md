# Brain Tumor Detection

This API provides an interface for detecting brain tumors from images using a pre-trained machine learning model (VGG16). It accepts base64-encoded images, processes them, and returns a prediction of whether the image contains a tumor.

# Features
   Brain Tumor Detection: Classifies images as either containing a brain tumor or not.
   Pre-trained Model: Uses a VGG16 model architecture with weights loaded from pre-trained files.
   Cross-Origin Support: Includes CORS to allow cross-origin requests (e.g., from a React frontend).

# Installation

 #1. Clone the repository:
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detection-api.git
 cd brain-tumor-detection-api

 #2. Install dependencies: Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required packages:
 pip install -r requirements.txt

 #3. Place the model files:
 Ensure that your model.json and model.h5 files (representing the pre-trained model and its weights) are in the root directory of the project.
 
 #4. python app.py

 #5. cd clients 

 #6. npm install

 #7. npm start
