# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection API

   This API provides an interface for detecting brain tumors from images using a pre-trained machine learning model (VGG16). It accepts base64-encoded images, processes 
   them, 
   and returns a prediction of whether the image contains a tumor.

# 🚀 Features
   Brain Tumor Detection: Classifies images as either containing a brain tumor or not with a high degree of accuracy.
   Pre-trained Model: Utilizes the VGG16 model architecture with pre-trained weights to enhance the prediction capability.
   Cross-Origin Support (CORS): This API can be accessed from a React frontend or other cross-origin platforms seamlessly.

# 🛠 Installation Guide
  Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

 1️⃣ Clone the Repository:
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detection-api.git
      cd brain-tumor-detection-api

 2️⃣ Install Dependencies: Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required packages:
      pip install -r requirements.txt

 3️⃣ Model Setup:
      Ensure that your model.json and model.h5 files (representing the pre-trained model and its weights) are in the root directory of the project.
 
 4️⃣ Start the API Server:
      python app.py

 5️⃣ Move to the Frontend:
      cd clients 

 6️⃣ Install Client-Side Dependencies:
      npm install

 7️⃣ Start the React Frontend:
      npm start
